                        This project focuses on designing and prototyping a custom fixture for
                        securely holding workpieces on a tribometer. Developed in Fusion360, the
                        CAD model includes a base plate, adjustable fixtures, and a fine-threaded
                        clamping system, with durable polymer components for smooth, precise
                        operation."
